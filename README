# FauxmoESP Alexa-Controlled LED

This project demonstrates how to use the FauxmoESP library to control an LED using Alexa. The LED can be turned on and off using voice commands via Amazon Alexa.

## Components Required

- ESP32 or ESP8266 microcontroller
- LED
- Resistor (220Ω is recommended)
- Breadboard and jumper wires
- USB cable for programming and power

## Circuit Diagram

Connect the components as follows:

1. Connect the anode (long leg) of the LED to GPIO 12 of the ESP32/ESP8266 through a 220Ω resistor.
2. Connect the cathode (short leg) of the LED to the GND pin of the ESP32/ESP8266.

## Software Requirements

- Arduino IDE (version 1.8.0 or higher)
- ESP32/ESP8266 board support installed in Arduino IDE
- FauxmoESP library installed in Arduino IDE

## Installation

1. **Install Arduino IDE:**
   Download and install the latest version of the Arduino IDE from [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).

2. **Install ESP32/ESP8266 Board Support:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE.
   - Go to `File > Preferences`.
   - In the "Additional Board Manager URLs" field, add:
     ```
     https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json
     http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json
     ```
   - Go to `Tools > Board > Boards Manager`.
   - Search for `ESP32` and `ESP8266` and install the respective packages.

3. **Install FauxmoESP Library:**
   - Go to `Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries`.
   - Search for `fauxmoESP` and install the latest version.

## Usage

1. **Open the Arduino IDE:**
   - Copy and paste the provided code into a new Arduino sketch.

2. **Replace Wi-Fi Credentials:**
   - Update the `WIFI_SSID` and `WIFI_PASS` macros with your Wi-Fi network's SSID and password.

3. **Upload the Sketch:**
   - Connect your ESP32/ESP8266 to your computer via USB.
   - Select the appropriate board and port from the `Tools` menu.
   - Click the upload button to program your ESP32/ESP8266.

4. **Set Up Alexa:**
   - Ensure your Alexa device is connected to the same Wi-Fi network as your ESP32/ESP8266.
   - Open the Alexa app and navigate to the device settings.
   - Ask Alexa to "discover devices" or manually add a new device. The LED should appear as "led one".

## Troubleshooting

- **Device Not Found by Alexa:** 
  - Ensure your ESP32/ESP8266 and Alexa are on the same Wi-Fi network.
  - Restart both the ESP32/ESP8266 and the Alexa device, then try discovering devices again.

- **LED Not Responding:**
  - Verify the circuit connections.
  - Check the serial monitor for any error messages.
  - Ensure the GPIO pin number matches your circuit.
